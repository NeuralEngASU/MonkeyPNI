Hello, 
 
 
This error message usually indicates that the WMI repository is corrupted, but sometimes may also indicate that some other system files are corrupted.
 
 
 
If you have any previous backup, I would highly suggest that you try restoring to that backup to see if the problem remains.
 
 
 
Or, would you please try the following steps to see if they can be of any help?
 
 
 
1. Disable and stop the WMI service.
 
     sc config winmgmt start= disabled
 
     net stop winmgmt
 
 
 
2. Run the following commands.
 
     Winmgmt /salvagerepository %windir%\System32\wbem      (I noticed that you have run this command, but I would suggest that you try it again)
 
     Winmgmt /resetrepository %windir%\System32\wbem
 
 
 
4. Re-enable the WMI service and then reboot the server to see how it goes.
 
     sc config winmgmt start= auto
 
 
 
If the problem remains, then try the following steps to rebuild the repository:
 
 
 
1. Disable and stop the WMI service.
 
     sc config winmgmt start= disabled     (note that there is a blank between '=' and 'disabled')
 
     net stop winmgmt
 
 
 
2. Rename the repository folder (located at %windir%\System32\wbem\repository) to repository.old.
 
 
 
3. Re-enable the WMI service.
 
     sc config winmgmt start= auto
 
 
 
4. Reboot the server to see if the problem remains.
 
 
 
If the above steps cannot help, you may also need to check if some disk sectors or system files are corrupted. You may try "chkdsk" and "sfc /scannow" commands to see if they can help. Otherwise, you may need to reinstall the whole server.
